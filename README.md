# **UltraLuckyBlocks 0.0.1**

This plugin adds **Lucky Blocks** to your server.
Currently, I use a pretty easy system, 
that drops a random amount of a random item.
This will surely be changed in the feature. 
I am going to rework the Lucky Block model as well.

### SETUP

You just need to implement the resource pack
from the resources folder  into your 
resource_packs folder. Then you'll need 
to add it in the **resource_packs.yml** as well.

**NOTE:** This Plugin fully depends on Customies. 
Customies is a very useful plugin, which makes it 
easier to register Blocks, Entities and Items
You can download Customies by following the link
